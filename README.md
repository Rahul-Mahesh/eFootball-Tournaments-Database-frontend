The most visually pleasing eFootball tournament maker and database

Planned release : Sometime 2024

Expected Features :

1. Fully fledged auction system, with customisable auction parameters.
2. Proper tournament to tournament progression for auctions, based on previous tournaments.
3. Fixture generator and Points table (duh obvious!).
4. Create rooms and see stats of previous tournaments.
5. Top scorers list and value increments in the auction market based on performance. (we can set custom auction parameters when creating a room, but player values will be based of their performance in previous tournaments)
6. Database with user specific data like goals scored in previous tournaments
